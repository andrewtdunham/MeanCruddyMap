# A MEAN, CRUD-y Map Application
This is a simple map-based web application built on the **MEAN** stack, that illustrates **CRUD** operations.

A quick definition of acromyms:

### MEAN

 - [**M**ongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a NoSQL database
 - [**E**xpress.js](http://expressjs.com/) - a web appilcation framework
 - [**A**ngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - a front-end javascript framework
 - [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org) - a server-side javascript runtime

The MEAN stack is a full-stack Javascript web-development framework. Since it utilizes only JavaScript, it provides a consistant development process.

### CRUD
 
 - **C**reate
 - **R**ead
 - **U**pdate
 - **D**elete

These 4 operations are the basic operations necessary for persistant-state storage. They are present in all relational database operations. A RESTful API should perform all of these operations.
